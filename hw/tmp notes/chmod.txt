        PERMISSION      COMMAND EXAMPLE   

         U   G   O
        rwx rwx rwx     chmod 777 filename      
        rwx rwx r-x     chmod 775 filename
        rwx r-x r-x     chmod 755 filename
        rw- rw- r--     chmod 664 filename
        rw- r-- r--     chmod 644 filename

        U = User 
        G = Group 
        O = Other

        r = Read
        w = write
        x = execute 
        - = no access

Symbolic syntax:
        [ugo] [[+-=][rwx]]              [user type to target][[add, remove, or set to][read and or write and or execute]]
        chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=r myfile     
        chmod go-rwx myDirectory        removes all permissions from group and other users

Options
        -c      verbose output when changes are made
        -f      silent
        -v      verbose
        -R      recursive
        --help  help

Hereâ€™s how the octal numbers break down:

Permissions:
	400     read by owner
	040     read by group
	004     read by anybody (other)
	200     write by owner
	020     write by group
	002     write by anybody
	100     execute by owner
	010     execute by group
	001     execute by anybody

So to manually set permissions, simply add up the columns.  So for example myscript.php you may want: Read,Write,Execute by you, Read,Write,Execute by group, read, execute by world = 400+200+100+040+020+010+004+001 = 775

# chmod 775 myscript.php
